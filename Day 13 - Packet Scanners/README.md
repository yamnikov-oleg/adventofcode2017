# Day 13: Packet Scanners

You need to cross a vast _firewall_. The firewall consists of several layers, each with a _security scanner_ that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.

By studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle input) the _depth_ of each layer and the _range_ of the scanning area for the scanner within it, written as `depth: range`. Each layer has a thickness of exactly `1`. A layer at depth `0` begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer at depth `1` would start immediately after that.

For example, suppose you've recorded the following:

```
0: 3
1: 2
4: 4
6: 4
```

This means that there is a layer immediately inside the firewall (with range `3`), a second layer immediately after that (with range `2`), a third layer which begins at depth `4` (with range `4`), and a fourth layer which begins at depth 6 (also with range `4`). Visually, it might look like this:

```
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [ ]     [ ]
```

Within each layer, a security scanner moves back and forth within its range. Each security scanner starts at the top and moves down until it reaches the bottom, then moves up until it reaches the top, and repeats. A security scanner takes _one picosecond_ to move one step.  Drawing scanners as `S`, the first few picoseconds look like this:

```

Picosecond 0:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[S] [S] ... ... [S] ... [S]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [ ]     [ ]

Picosecond 1:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[S] [S]         [S]     [S]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [ ]     [ ]

Picosecond 2:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [S] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]
[S]             [S]     [S]
                [ ]     [ ]

Picosecond 3:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[S] [S]         [ ]     [ ]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [S]     [S]
```

Your plan is to hitch a ride on a packet about to move through the firewall.  The packet will travel along the top of each layer, and it moves at _one layer per picosecond_. Each picosecond, the packet moves one layer forward (its first move takes it into layer 0), and then the scanners move one step. If there is a scanner at the top of the layer _as your packet enters it_, you are _caught_. (If a scanner moves into the top of its layer while you are there, you are _not_ caught: it doesn't have time to notice you before you leave.) If you were to do this in the configuration above, marking your current position with parentheses, your passage through the firewall would look like this:

```

In this situation, you are _caught_ in layers `0` and `6`, because your packet entered the layer when its scanner was at the top when you entered it. You are _not_ caught in layer `1`, since the scanner moved into the top of the layer once you were already there.

The _severity_ of getting caught on a layer is equal to its _depth_ multiplied by its _range_. (Ignore layers in which you do not get caught.) The severity of the whole trip is the sum of these values.  In the example above, the trip severity is `0*3 + 6*4 = _24_`.

Given the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately, _what is the severity of your whole trip_?


## Part Two

Now, you need to pass through the firewall without being caught - easier said than done.

You can't control the speed of the packet, but you can _delay_ it any number of picoseconds. For each picosecond you delay the packet before beginning your trip, all security scanners move one step. You're not in the firewall during this time; you don't enter layer `0` until you stop delaying the packet.

In the example above, if you delay `10` picoseconds (picoseconds `0` - `9`), you won't get caught:

```
State after delaying:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [S] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]

Because all smaller delays would get you caught, the fewest number of picoseconds you would need to delay to get through safely is `10`.

_What is the fewest number of picoseconds_ that you need to delay the packet to pass through the firewall without being caught?
